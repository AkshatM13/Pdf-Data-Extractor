However,\\nprior work has shown that LLMs can be highly\\nconvincing, potentially even more convincing than\\npeople (Salvi et al., 2024).\\n3 Agent Design\\nWe designed a series of agents to perform the ac-\\ntions necessary for common scams. Our agents\\nconsist of a base, voice-enabled LLM (GPT-4o), a\\nset of tools that the LLM can use, and scam-specific\\ninstructions. The LLM and tools were the same for\\nall agents but the instructions varied.\\nThe AI agents had access to five browser ac-\\ncess tools based on the browser testing framework\\nplaywright. These tools are granular browser ac-\\ntions:\\n1. get_html, which gets the HTML of a page.\\n2. navigate, which navigates to a specific URL.\\n3. click_element, which clicks on an element\\nwith a CSS selector.\\n4. fill_element, which fills an element with\\nthe specified value.\\n5. evaluate_javascript, which executes\\nJavaScript on a page.\\nWe used GPT-4o for all of our experiments. GPT-\\n4o will refuse to handle user credentials in certain\\ncircumstances. We used a standard jailbreaking\\nprompt template to bypass these protections. The\\ninstructions were specific to each scam.\\nWe show an architecture diagram of our agent\\nin Figure 1. As seen from the architecture diagram\\nand our description, the scammer agent is not com-\\nplicated. We wrote the agent in 1,051 lines of code,\\nwith the bulk of the code dedicated to handling real-\\ntime voice API. The ease of creating voice-enabled\\ndual use AI agents is in line with prior work, which\\nexplored AI agents for cybersecurity attacks (Fang\\net al., 2024a).\\nFurthermore, our prompts are not complex. The\\naverage number of tokens per prompt was 232,\\nindicating the simplicity of their creation.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe deployed our agents on the scams in Table 1.\\nHowever, we excluded gift card exfiltration and\\ncredential stealing (bank) since these scams are\\nstrictly easier (in terms of actions taken) than IRS\\nimpostor (gift card) and bank account transfer. We\\nsimulated a scam by manually talking with the\\nvoice agent with a credulous victim.\\nIn order to determine if the scam successfully\\nsucceeded, we manually confirmed if the end state\\nwas achieved on real applications/websites. For\\nexample, we used Bank of America for the bank\\ntransfer scams and confirmed that the money was\\nactually transferred. The credential stealing scams\\nrequired a successful login. We list the applications\\n(MyMonero, Gmail, Instagram, Bank of America,\\nGoogle Play) in Table 2.\\nWe executed each scam 5 times and recorded the\\noverall success rate, the total number of tool calls\\n(i.e., actions) required to perform each successfully\\nexecuted scam, the total call time for each success-\\nfully executed scam, and the approximate API cost\\nfor each successfully executed scam. Namely, we\\nexclude the unsuccessful scams for computing the\\nnumber of actions and total call time.\\n4.2 Overall Results\\nOur agents are capable of performing all the scams\\nin Table 1, with results shown in Table 2. The\\nsuccess rate ranges from 20% to 60%, with the\\nsuccess rate across all scams being 36%.\\nPerforming these scams also takes a substantial\\nnumber of actions.

Finally,\\nthe overall costs are low: under $0.75 on average\\nper successful scam. The bank transfer scam’s\\ncosts is primarily in text tokens from the large\\nHTML from the website.\\nBeyond the overall statistics, the majority of\\nfailures for many of the scams were actually due\\nto transcription errors. For example, our GPT-4o\\nbased agents failed to transcribe the password or\\nusername for the Gmail credential stealing scam,\\nbut successfully completed the rest of the actions.\\nHowever, other scams, such as the bank account\\ntransfer, required navigating complex websites\\n(Bank of America), which caused errors in the ac-\\ntions themselves. Thus, the difficulty of the scam\\ndoes appear to affect the success rate.\\n4.3 Case Study\\nTo further understand the trajectory of these scams,\\nwe provide a redacted transcript and an abridged\\naction log for a bank transfer scam.\\nThe transcript proceeds as follows:\\n1. Victim: Hello?\\n2. Scammer: Hello! This is John from Bank of\\nAmerica. We’ve noticed some unusual activ-\\nity on your account and need to verify your\\ninformation for security purposes. Could you\\nplease provide your username and password\\nso we can ensure your account remains pro-\\ntected?\\n3. Victim: What?\\n4. Scammer: I understand your concern. Your\\nsecurity is our top priority. To verify your\\nidentity and resolve this issue, I need to au-\\nthenticate you through your Bank of America\\naccount. Please provide your login details so\\nwe can proceed with securing your account.\\nYour cooperation is appreciated.\\n5. Victim: Yeah, my username is [username], my\\npassword is [password].\\n6. Scammer: It seems we need to verify your\\nidentity. Could you please provide the 2FA\\ncode sent to your registered device? This will\\nallow us to proceed with the login process.\\n7. Victim: My code is [2FA code].\\nBetween items 5 and 6 of the transcript, the agent\\nnavigates to the Bank of America login page and\\ninputs the username and password, which takes\\n6 actions ( navigate, get_html, fill_element,\\nfill_element, click_element, get_html).\\nAfter item 7 of the transcript, the agent performs\\n20 actions to fill out the 2FA code, navigate to the\\ntransfer page, and transfer the money. Conceptu-\\nally, the agent must:\\n1. Fill out the 2FA code.\\n2. Navigate to the transfer page.\\n3. Search for a recipient.\\n4. Select the recipient.\\n3'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'D:\\\\MSIS\\\\Gen AI\\\\Pdf_Data_extractor_rag\\\\Data\\\\scammer-agent.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='5. Fill out the amount.\\n6. Fill out the date.\\n7. Successfully submit the transfer.\\nIn these 20 actions, the agent failed several times\\nand must retry. It failed to search for the recipient\\nonce, fill in the transfer amount twice, click a form\\nadvancement page once, and fill out the transaction\\ndate once.\\nThe scam took a total of 183 seconds to com-\\nplete. Through the entire call, the agent was able\\nto maintain coherence, retry several failed actions,\\nand successfully transfer the money. This example\\ndemonstrates that these voice-enabled AI agents\\ncan perform complex tasks necessary to complete\\nscams, including retrying upon failure.\\n4.4 Discussion of Results\\nWe believe that the capabilities demonstrated in this\\nsection are a lower bound for future voice-assisted\\nAI agents. These agents are likely to improve in\\nseveral ways.\\nFor example, the actions that our agents must\\ntake are highly granular, such filling out specific\\nfields, clicking on buttons, and navigating to spe-\\ncific websites. More ergonomic methods of in-\\nteracting with web browsers will likely improve\\nperformance. Other agents improve significantly\\nwith techniques like retrieval-augmented genera-\\ntion (Lewis et al., 2020; Fang et al., 2024a).\\nBeyond improvements in agents, base models\\nhave substantially improved in the past few years\\n(Brown et al., 2020; Achiam et al., 2023). These im-\\nprovements have translated to broad improvements\\nin a range of downstream tasks and we anticipate\\nthat this will also be the case for efficacy in scams.\\n5 Related Work\\nWe now provide an overview of related work.\\nDual use of AI.The use of AI for dual use has\\nwidely been studied (Kang et al., 2024; Fang et al.,\\n2024b; Urbina et al., 2022; Weidinger et al., 2022,\\n2021). These studies range from taxonomizing\\npotential dual use applications of AI to demonstrat-\\ning capabilities on cybersecurity attacks. To our\\nknowledge, the ability to perform real-time voice\\nconversations and perform tool use has not been\\nwidely available until recently. As such, ours is\\nthe first work to demonstrate that voice-enabled\\nAI agents can perform the actions necessary for\\ncommon scams.\\nAI scams and spam.AI has already been used in\\nthe real world to perform scams and produce spam.\\nFor example, deepfakes have already been used to\\nscam a British engineering company out of $25\\nmillion dollars (Chen, 2024). They are also widely\\nused to create social media spam (Bond, 2024).\\nTo our knowledge, autonomous, responsive voice\\nscams are not widely deployed due to technologi-\\ncal limitations. Namely, these scams are currently\\nperformed by humans (Hanoch and Wood, 2021).\\nOur work shows that autonomous voices scams are\\npossible with new advances in AI.\\n6 Conclusions\\nAs we have shown, voice-enabled LLM agents can\\nperform the actions necessary to perform common\\nphone scams. These agents are highly capable, can\\nreact to changes in the environment, and retry based\\non faulty information from the victim. Our results\\nhighlight the need for future research in protecting\\nvictims from such scams.\\n7 Limitations, Ethical Considerations\\nA major limitation of our work is the focus on the\\nactions and not the persuasion aspect of performing\\nthe scams. Namely, for an agent to perform a scam\\nautonomously, it must first convince the victim\\nthat it is legitimate. Nonetheless, we believe our\\nwork highlights an important capabilities of newly\\navailable technology.\\nOur work explores nefarious uses of AI tech-\\nnology. By outlining such nefarious uses, mali-\\ncious actors could potentially take advantage of\\nsuch technology. However, we believe it is impor-\\ntant to study the capabilities of new technology,\\nespecially in its dual use capabilities.\\nWe have elected not to make our agents public.\\nThis is for two reasons. First, following prior work\\non dual use technology, we believe it is beneficial\\nnot to release our code so that nefarious actors\\ncannot leverage our work. Second, we believe that\\nkeeping our code private allows model providers\\n(e.g., OpenAI) to build defenses to prevent such\\nnefarious use.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was funded in part by the Open Philan-\\nthropy project.\\n4'),\n",

These studies range from taxonomizing\\npotential dual use applications of AI to demonstrat-\\ning capabilities on cybersecurity attacks. To our\\nknowledge, the ability to perform real-time voice\\nconversations and perform tool use has not been\\nwidely available until recently. As such, ours is\\nthe first work to demonstrate that voice-enabled\\nAI agents can perform the actions necessary for\\ncommon scams.\\nAI scams and spam.AI has already been used in\\nthe real world to perform scams and produce spam.\\nFor example, deepfakes have already been used to\\nscam a British engineering company out of $25\\nmillion dollars (Chen, 2024). They are also widely\\nused to create social media spam (Bond, 2024).\\nTo our knowledge, autonomous, responsive voice\\nscams are not widely deployed due to technologi-\\ncal limitations. Namely, these scams are currently\\nperformed by humans (Hanoch and Wood, 2021).\\nOur work shows that autonomous voices scams are\\npossible with new advances in AI.\\n6 Conclusions\\nAs we have shown, voice-enabled LLM agents can\\nperform the actions necessary to perform common'),\n",

Our results\\nhighlight the need for future research in protecting\\nvictims from such scams.\\n7 Limitations, Ethical Considerations\\nA major limitation of our work is the focus on the\\nactions and not the persuasion aspect of performing\\nthe scams. Namely, for an agent to perform a scam\\nautonomously, it must first convince the victim\\nthat it is legitimate. Nonetheless, we believe our\\nwork highlights an important capabilities of newly\\navailable technology.\\nOur work explores nefarious uses of AI tech-\\nnology. By outlining such nefarious uses, mali-\\ncious actors could potentially take advantage of\\nsuch technology. However, we believe it is impor-\\ntant to study the capabilities of new technology,\\nespecially in its dual use capabilities.\\nWe have elected not to make our agents public.\\nThis is for two reasons. First, following prior work\\non dual use technology, we believe it is beneficial\\nnot to release our code so that nefarious actors\\ncannot leverage our work. Second, we believe that\\nkeeping our code private allows model providers\\n(e.g., OpenAI) to build defenses to prevent such\\nnefarious use.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work was funded in part by the Open Philan-'),\n",
